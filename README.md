# Title : Clustering Using PyCaret

## **1. Description**
1) We need to import the dataset from the UCI library. Here I have chosen the Wine Dataset from UCI.
2) Perform Cluster Analysis with the help of PyCaret Library.
3) Make a result table.

## **2. Output**
1. K-Means Clustering

2. Hierarchical Clustering

3. Birch Clustering

## **3. Conclusion**
In some cases it might happen that when we use preprocessing techniques on our dataset, the associated scores increases and sometimes it might decrease as well as we can see from our Results.
Best Silhouette Score = 0.5711 in K-means Clustering with Number of Clusters = 3
